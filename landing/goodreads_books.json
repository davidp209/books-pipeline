Do you have to hire one of these priests of the dark arts, the \"data scientist,\" to extract this gold from your data? Nope.\nData science is little more than using straight-forward steps to process raw data into actionable insight. And in Data Smart, author and data scientist John Foreman will show you how that's done within the familiar environment of a spreadsheet. \nWhy a spreadsheet? It's comfortable! You get to look at the data every step of the way, building confidence as you learn the tricks of the trade. Plus, spreadsheets are a vendor-neutral place to learn data science without the hype. \nBut don't let the Excel sheets fool you. This is a book for those serious about learning the analytic techniques, the math and the magic, behind big data.\nEach chapter will cover a different technique in a spreadsheet so you can follow along:\n - Mathematical optimization, including non-linear programming and genetic algorithms\n- Clustering via k-means, spherical k-means, and graph modularity\n- Data mining in graphs, such as outlier detection\n- Supervised AI through logistic regression, ensemble models, and bag-of-words models\n- Forecasting, seasonal adjustments, and prediction intervals through monte carlo simulation\n- Moving from spreadsheets into the R programming language\nYou get your hands dirty as you work alongside John through each technique.

This data helps us monitor our planet, decipher our genetic code, and take a deep dive into our psychology.\nAs algorithms become increasingly adept at accessing our minds, they also become more and more powerful at controlling it—enticing us to buy a certain product or vote for a certain political candidate. Some of us say this technological trend is no big deal. Others consider it one of the greatest threats to humanity. But what if the truth is more nuanced and mind-bending than that?\nIn Mindmasters, Columbia Business School professor Sandra Matz offers a fascinating insider perspective on the art and data-driven science of psychological targeting. By relating her own personal story of growing up in a small village—where few aspects of life remain truly private—to her groundbreaking research in computational psychology, Matz reveals how Big Data offers insights into the most intimate aspects of our psyche and how these insights empower external influence over the choices we make.\nFilled with Ted-Talk-like explanations and real-life examples from Matz's research and consulting work, Mindmasters paints a nuanced picture of the power of psychological targeting. Like nosy neighbors, it can be creepy, manipulative, and downright harmful—with scandals like Cambridge Analytica being merely the tip of the iceberg. Yet, like any tight-knit, supportive village community, it also holds enormous potential to help us live healthier and happier lives—for example, by improving our mental health, encouraging better financial decisions, or enabling us to break out of our echo chambers.\nWith passion and clear-eyed precision, Matz shows us how to manage psychological targeting and redesign the data game in a way that empowers us to take back control and ask more of our personal data.\nMindmasters is a riveting look at what our digital footprints reveal about us, how they're being used—for good and for ill—and how we can gain more control and power over the data that define us.", "num_pages": 240, "format": "Hardcover", "rating_value": 4.04, "rating_count": 290, "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205905685", "ingestion_date": "2025-11-21T01:03:39.846459"}
